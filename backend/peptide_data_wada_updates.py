    "researchStatus": "Research compound - Erythropoietin receptor agonist",
    "description": "ARA-290, also known as Cibinetide, is a synthetic peptide derived from erythropoietin that selectively activates the innate repair receptor (IRR) without stimulating red blood cell production. It was originally developed for treating diabetic neuropathy and has shown promise in various neuroprotective and tissue repair applications. Unlike EPO, ARA-290 does not increase hematocrit, making it potentially safer for therapeutic use while retaining tissue-protective properties.",
