        <p>Route selection between intramuscular and subcutaneous administration requires understanding absorption kinetics and research objective alignment. Intramuscular routes provide faster absorption through increased vascularization, while subcutaneous routes offer slower, sustained release characteristics. Research protocols examine bioavailability differences, peak concentration timing, and duration profiles for optimal route matching to study requirements.</p>
        
        <p>Tissue tolerance considerations influence route selection, with subcutaneous administration typically showing improved comfort profiles and reduced injection site reactions. Volume limitations differ between routes, affecting dosing protocol design.</p>
        
        <p>Current route selection research continues examining peptide-specific absorption patterns and advanced delivery optimization. Comparative studies provide evidence-based selection criteria for improved research outcomes and protocol efficiency.</p>
