        <p>Copper peptides (GHK-Cu) function as tissue remodeling promoters in dermatological research studies. Laboratory investigations examine their role in collagen synthesis enhancement and wound healing acceleration through copper ion delivery and growth factor activation in controlled experimental environments.</p>
        
        <p>Research protocols investigate copper peptides' influence on antioxidant enzyme activation and inflammatory response modulation. Current studies focus on dermal regeneration mechanisms and extracellular matrix remodeling processes.</p>
        
        <p>Clinical applications demonstrate improved wound healing rates and skin texture enhancement, with ongoing research examining optimal copper concentrations and peptide carrier systems.</p>
